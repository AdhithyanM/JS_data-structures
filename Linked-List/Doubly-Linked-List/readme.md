Singly Linked List:
-------------------
* Each nodes will have the property next and value.
* next is a reference that points to the next node in the linked list.

Doubly Linked List:
-------------------
* Each node contains value, next, prev.
* next is a reference that points to the next node in the linked list.
* prev is a reference that points to the previous node in the linked list.
* This makes insertion and removal at both ends possible in constant time complexity at the expense of more space.
