LinkedList:
-----------
* A Linked List is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes,
* Each node consists of a data value and a pointer that points to the next node.
* The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure.
* Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity.


Methods:
--------
* preprend(value) - to insert an item at front - O(1)
* append(value) - to insert an item at end - O(1)
* insert(value, index) - to insert an item at a particular index - O(n)
* removeFrom(index) - to remove an item from particular index - O(n)
* remove(value) - to remove a particular value - O(n)
* search(value) - to find the index of particular value - O(n)
* print() - to visualize the elements in the linked list
* reverse() - to reverse the linked list - O(n)

Usage:
------
* All applications of both stacks and queues are applications of linked lists.
* Image viewer (slideshows...)
