Queue:
------
* The queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of First In First Out (FIFO).
* The first element inserted into the queue is first element to be removed.
* A queue of people. People enter the queue at one end (rear/tail) and leave the queue from the other end (front/head).
* Queue is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behaviour rather than being a mathematical model.


Methods:
--------
* enqueue(element) - adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection
* dequeue() - removes an element from the front/head of the collection
* peek() - get the value of the element at the front of the queue without removing it
* isEmpty() - check if the queue is empty
* size() - get the number of elements in the queue
* print() - visualize the elements in the queue


Usage:
------
* When you want to process in an orderly fashion.
* Printers
* CPU task scheduling
* Callback queue in Javascript runtime
