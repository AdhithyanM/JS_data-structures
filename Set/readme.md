Set:
----
* A set is a data structure that can hold a collection of unique values.
* It can contain a mix of different data types.
* Sets are dynamically sized.
* Sets do not maintain an insertion order like arrays.
* Sets are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop.


Set vs Array:
-------------
* Arrays can contain duplicate values whereas Sets cannot.
* Insertion order is maintained in arrays but it is not the case with sets.
* Searching and deleting an element in the set is faster compared to arrays.
