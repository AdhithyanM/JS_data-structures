Stack:
------
* The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO).
* The last element inserted into the stack is first element to be removed.
* A Stack of Plates. The last plate placed on top of the stack is also the first plate removed from the stack.
* Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.


Methods:
--------
* push(element) - adds an element to the collection.
* pop() - removes the most recently added element from the collection.
* peek() - get the value of the top without removing it.
* isEmpty() - check if the stack is empty.
* size() - get the number of elements in the stack.
* print() - visualize the elements in the stack.


Usage:
------
* To traceback our steps 
* Browser history tracking
* Undo operation when typing
* Expression conversions like infix to postfix
* Call Stack in Javascript runtime
