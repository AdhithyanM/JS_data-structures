Binary Tree:
------------
* A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most 2 children.
* They are referred to as left child and right child.


Binary Search Tree - BST:
-------------------------
* The value of each left node must be smaller than the parent node.
* The value of each right node must be greater than the parent node.
* Each node has at most two children.


Operations:
-----------
* Insertion - to add a node to the tree
* Search - to find a node given its value
* DFS & BFS - to visit all nodes in the tree
* Deletion - to remove a node given its value


Usage:
------
* Searching
* Sorting
* To implement abstract data types such as
  * lookup tables
  * priority queues
